    <h1><i>Polar</i> Bears</h1>
    <p>A chemistry-based choose-your-own adventure game! This website hosts V1 of this project. This project is completely free for personal and educational use.</p>

    <p>The storylines of this game were carefully crafted with the help of OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3) 3 which is a textual machine learning model for private, non-commerical, personal use.</p>

    <b>How to play:</b> To play, simply select the button above. You will be given details about the story and you will be asked to choose an option to continue your story. After each choice, you must answer a chemistry question. If you answer correctly, you can try again but one point will be added to your score (less points is better, like golf). You can always play again to improve your score!

    <br><br>
    <b>Question Content:</b> The questions that will be asked are based on high-school-level chemistry.
