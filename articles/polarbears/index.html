    <p><b>Overview:</b> A chemistry-based choose-your-own adventure game! This website hosts the initial version of this project created with JavaScript. This project is completely free and open source for personal and educational use. In this game, you will choose your own adventure in a story involving questions on the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Structures and Properties of Matter (3 questions)</li>
      <li>Organic Chemistry (6 questions)</li>
      <li>Energy Changes and Rates of Reactions (6 questions)</li>
      <li>Chemical Systems and Equilibrium (6 questions)</li>
      <li>Electrochemistry (2 questions)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The storylines of this game were carefully crafted with the help of OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT-3) 3 which is a textual machine learning model for private, non-commerical, personal use. In other words, elements of this story were not generated by a human!</p>

    <p><b>How to play:</b> To play, simply select the button above. You will be given details about the story and you will be asked to choose an option to continue your story. After each choice, you must answer a chemistry question. If you answer correctly, you can try again but one point will be added to your score (less points is better, like golf). You can always play again to improve your score!</p>
    <p> <b>Question Content:</b> The questions that will be asked are based on high-school-level chemistry. You can view the <b>complete question/answer directory</b> <a href="#" onclick="loadAnswers()">here</a>. You can also view the full story mockup <a target="_blank" href="https://r0h.in/articles/polarbears/story.png">here</a> or the fully expanded one <a target="_blank" href="https://r0h.in/articles/polarbears/story-expanded.png">here</a> (large file). Finally, you can see the source code for this website <a href="https://github.com/r0hin/r0hin/tree/master/articles/polarbears"> here.</a> The specific JavaScript file that manages the game is <a href="https://github.com/r0hin/r0hin/blob/master/articles/polarbears/assets/scripts.js" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
